# Twitter sentimental analysis
# Abstract
The project aims to build twitter sentimental analysis. 
Tweets are processed using Natural language processing.
The models used for classifying are Naive bayes and Logistic Regression, which classify the tweets as negative or positive.
# What you have done?
I have taken dataset from kaggle. 
Data is then preprocessed.
By using Natural Language Processing, tweets are processed.
For the prediction, models used are Logistic Regression and Naïve bayes models.
Tweets have been classified as positive or negative
# How you have done?
1) Loaded the dataset.
2) Data is preprocessed. Tweets are processed using Natural Language Processing.
3) Prediction of the tweets, whether the tweets are negative or positive, is done   by using Logistic Regression and Naïve bayes.
4) All evaluating parameters and confusion matrix is obtained.
# Result achieved
The sentimental analysis of twitter has been done using the model.
